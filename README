Synopsis
--------
This code is for spectral element solution of (incompressible
Navier--Stokes) time-varying and elliptic PDEs.  Geometries
accommodated are 2D Cartesian or cylindrical, and "2+1/2D", i.e. 2D x
Fourier, again Cartesian or cylindrical.

Distribution
------------
The src directory contains source for the central routines/classes of
spectral/finite element solvers.  Application programs/Makefiles can
be found in upper-level directories:

elliptic  Solve elliptic (Laplace, Poisson, Helmholtz) problems.
dns       Navier--Stokes DNS in Cartesian or cylindrical geometries.
utility   Various utility programs.

The code has been tested with (and makefiles support) the following
operating systems: SGI IRIX6.5 (32 & 64-bit), DEC OSF1/Digital Unix,
GNU/Linux (iX86 & alpha), Fujitsu VPP300, NEC SX-4/5, Mac OSX 10.3,
Linux-AMD Opteron x86_64 and Linix-Intel Itanium-2 ia64.

Makefiles assume GNUmake: for purposes of automated compilation and
testing decribed below "gmake", in your path, should find GNUmake.
You should also have RCS installed on your system.  SuperMongo and
Amtec's TECPLOT would be nice to have but are not needed.  For
concurrent execution MPI is required.  You will also need C, C++ and
FORTRAN77 (or F90, F95) compilers.

Starting out
------------

Say "make test" at the top level of the directory tree. All tests
should report as "passed".

The long-hand way to do the above is:

1.  Run uname -s.  Check there is a matching directory under the lib
    directory and that it contains libalp.a and libfem.a.  If not, run
    "make libs".

2.  Change directory to utility.  Make "enumerate", and "compare" at least,
    or just make to create all the utilities.  You will need to put
    enumerate and compare in your path as other codes will try to run
    them.

3.  Change directory to dns; make; cd ../test; testregress
    ../dns/dns.

Files
-----
Semtex uses a base input file which describes the mesh and boundary
conditions.  We call this a "session" file and typically it has no
root extension.  It is written in a format patterned on HTML, which we
have called FEML (for Finite Element Markup Language).  There are a
number of example session files in the mesh directory.  Other files
have standard extensions:

session.num  Global node numbers, produced by enumerate utility.
session.fld  Solution/field file.  Binary format by default.
session.rst  Restart file.  Read in to initialize solution if present.
session.avg  Average file.  Used to store time-mean averages.

After writing a new session file it is best to run meshpr on it before
trying to use it for simulations.  Meshpr will catch most of the
easier-to-make errors.  You can also plot up the results using
SuperMongo or other utility as a visual check.

Utilities
---------
Can be found in the utility directory:

enumerate Generate global node numbering, with RCM optimization.
compare   Generate restart files, compare solutions to a function.
convert   Convert field file formats (IEEE-big/little, ASCII).
meshpr    Generate 2D mesh locations for plotting or checking.
addvort   Add vorticity vector components to a field file.
addfield  Add vorticity, also divergence, helicity, etc.
sem2tec   Convert field files to Amtec TECPLOT format.
project   Convert a field file to a different order interpolation.
interp    Interpolate field file from one 2D mesh to another.
probe     Probe field file at specified points.
noiz      Add a random perturbation to a field file.
calc      An interactive calculator that calls the built-in function parser.
rstress   Compute a Reynolds stresses from a .avg file, subtract averages.

All executables have a -h command line option which gives a help prompt.

Notes for specific systems
--------------------------

1.  Linux: the GNU FORTRAN library may be called f2c or g2c,
apparently depending on the release of g77 installed.  Makefiles
assume g2c, but you may have to change that to f2c or make a symbolic
link from /usr/lib/libf2c.a to /usr/lib/libg2c.a if you have trouble
in the link stages of compilation.
